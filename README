Bashman, a pac-man-like bash game 

This is a simple random maze game where there's a man, a monster
and an exit.
The man will try to collect as many points in the maze as possible 
before reaching the exit. 
The monster will try to approach and beat the man. If the monster 
catches the man, the man "loses" health. When this happens or when 
the exit is reached the game restarts in a new random maze.
When the man's health reaches 10% his health can be restored by 
reaching a position at the maze.
If the man is surrounded by walls or needs to escape the monster, 
he can use a bomb to destroy the walls surrounding him.             
When there's only one bomb left bombs can be collected at a random
point in the maze. 
The monster senses vibrations in the maze and tries to match his 
coordinates to the man's.
Every time the monster hits a wall with his movement it increases 
his 'rage' level. When this level reaches 100% the monsters is 
able to destroy all the the walls surrounding him.
A file ~/.bashman_scores with the player's names and the highest 
scores is created.
By chance 'bashman' means 'wanker' somewhere :D  

Usage:
  bashman.sh [player_name] [maze_rows] [maze_columns] [-h or --help]"

To do: 
  -Some messages should be shown at the middle of the maze
  -More monsters.
